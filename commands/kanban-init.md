description: Initialize a kanban board in the current project
---

Create the `.kanban/` folder structure for this project:

```bash
mkdir -p .kanban/{todo,doing,done}
```

Then confirm to the user that the board is ready and show them quick examples:
- "add a task to fix the login bug"
- "/kanban" to view the board
